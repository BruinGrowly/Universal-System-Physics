### 2. [Experimental Protocols](experimental-protocols.md)
**Rigorous testing procedures for validating USP predictions**

Seven detailed protocols:

#### Protocol 1: Prayer Efficacy Measurement
- Tests spiritual → physical causal chain
- 12-week study, N=120 participants
- Measures correlation between harmony H and life outcomes
- **Expected**: High H → better outcomes (p < 0.01)

#### Protocol 2: Consciousness-Quantum Bridge
- Tests observer effect on quantum random number generators
- Trained meditators attempt to bias QRNG
- **Expected**: H ≥ 0.77 subjects show 1-2% bias (p < 0.001)

#### Protocol 3: TruthSense Deception Detection
- Validates Justice Force field-based lie detection
- ROC analysis, N=200 statements
- **Expected**: AUC > 0.75, sensitivity 75-85%

#### Protocol 4: Anchor Point Navigation (Personal Growth)
- 6-month LJWP optimization vs control
- N=90 participants
- **Expected**: ΔH = +0.18 vs +0.04 (p < 0.001)

#### Protocol 5: Team Harmony Optimization
- 3-month team LJWP tracking
- N=20 teams (10 USP, 10 control)
- **Expected**: 30% velocity increase vs 10%

#### Protocol 6: Coupling Coefficient Measurement
- Empirically determine κ_ij matrix
- Perturbation experiments
- **Expected**: Positive definite matrix, κ_LJ > 0, etc.

#### Protocol 7: Bridge Transformation Coefficients
- Measure τ_S, A_C, and other bridge constants
- Spiritual → Consciousness → Quantum → Physical
- **Expected**: τ_S ≈ 5-30 minutes depending on H

**Audience**: Experimental psychologists, consciousness researchers, anyone wanting to test USP

**Key Result**: All protocols are feasible with current technology; predictions are testable

### 3. [Golden Ratio Convergence](golden-ratio-convergence.md)
**Mathematical proof that optimal growth follows φ = 1.618...**

Proves:

**Main Theorem**: Convergence to (1,1,1,1) is optimal when step size α = 1/φ ≈ 0.618

Contents:
- Multiple proofs (optimization, Fibonacci search, continuous-time)
- Multi-dimensional extension (all four LJWP dimensions)
- Fibonacci spiral trajectory in LJWP space
- Connection to natural growth patterns
- Experimental validation predictions
- Practical application (personal growth strategy)

**Key Insights**:
- φ-scaling minimizes time + energy + overshoot
- Same law governs seashells, galaxies, and spiritual growth
- Natural systems "know" φ because it's mathematically optimal
- Your growth toward JEHOVAH should follow φ rhythm

**Audience**: Mathematicians, optimization theorists, anyone interested in why φ appears everywhere

**Key Result**: Golden Ratio isn't mystical - it's the unique optimum for multi-dimensional convergence
