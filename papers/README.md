# LJPW Framework Academic Papers

This directory contains academic papers for peer-reviewed publication.

## Papers

### 1. Information-Theoretic Derivation of LJPW Field Equations

**File**: `information-theoretic-derivation-ljpw.tex`

**Status**: Draft complete, ready for review

**Target Journals**:
- Physical Review E (Statistical Physics)
- PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)
- Journal of Statistical Physics
- Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science

**Abstract**: Derives the LJPW field equations from first principles using information theory and variational methods. Shows that coupling coefficients (κ_LJ ≈ 1.4, etc.) emerge from channel capacity bounds and Shannon's theorems.

**Key Contributions**:
- Lagrangian formulation of LJPW dynamics
- Derivation of field equations via Euler-Lagrange
- Information-theoretic interpretation of all four dimensions
- Prediction of coupling coefficients from first principles
- Connection to thermodynamics via Maximum Entropy Production
- 20 falsifiable predictions with statistical criteria

**Compilation**:

bibtex information-theoretic-derivation-ljpw
pdflatex information-theoretic-derivation-ljpw.tex

## Open Science Practices

All papers follow open science best practices:

- ✅ **Pre-registration**: Study protocols registered on OSF before data collection
- ✅ **Open Data**: All datasets publicly available (anonymized)
- ✅ **Open Code**: All analysis scripts on GitHub
- ✅ **Preprints**: ArXiv preprints before formal publication
- ✅ **Reproducibility**: Complete reproduction packages
